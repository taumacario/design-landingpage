# Design-landingpage üñ•Ô∏è

Searching some free layout sites to train HTML and CSS, I found this design, 
I extracted the elements through Figma and made this landing page. 
First time I worked responsibly.

This landing page was challenging for me, it was the first 'big' page I coded, on March of 2022.

Looking at it now, I see many things that I could have done better, 
but I decided not to change so that I can compare with other projects and see my evolution.
